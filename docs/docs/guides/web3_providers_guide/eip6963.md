# EIP-6963: Multi Injected Provider Discovery

## Introduction

EIP-6963 proposes the "Multi Injected Provider Discovery" standard, which aims to enhance the discoverability and interaction with multiple injected Ethereum providers in a browser environment. Injected providers refer to browser extensions or other injected scripts that provide access to an Ethereum provider within the context of a web application.

Web3.js library has utility function for discovery of injected providers using `requestEIP6963Providers()` function. When `requestEIP6963Providers()` is used it returns `eip6963Providers` Map object. This Map object is in global scope so every time `requestEIP6963Providers()` function is called it will update Map object and return it. 

`eip6963Providers` Map object has provider's `UUID` as keys and `EIP6963ProviderDetail` as values. `EIP6963ProviderDetail` is:

```ts
export interface EIP6963ProviderDetail {
  info: EIP6963ProviderInfo;
  provider: EIP1193Provider;
}
```

where `info` has details of provider containing UUID, name, Icon and RDNS as defined in EIP-6963:

```ts
export interface EIP6963ProviderInfo {
  uuid: string;
  name: string;
  icon: string;
  rdns: string;
}
```

`provider` in `EIP6963ProviderDetail` is `EIP1193Provider` and it contains actual provider that can be injected in web3 instance.

Following code snippet demonstrates usage of `requestEIP6963Providers()` function for providers discovery. 

```ts
//Assuming multiple providers are installed in browser. 

import { Web3 } from 'web3';

const providers = Web3.requestEIP6963Providers();

for (const [key, value] of providers) {
    console.log(value);

/* Based on your DApp's logic show use list of providers and get selected provider's UUID from user for injecting its EIP6963ProviderDetail.provider EIP1193 object into web3 object */

    if (value.info.name === 'MetaMask') {
        const web3 = new Web3(value.provider);

    // now you can use web3 object with injected provider
        console.log(await web3.eth.getTransaction('0x82512812c11f56aa2474a16d5cc8916b73cd6ed96bf9b8defb3499ec2d9070cb'));
    }
}

```
